## Hi there 👋

I'm 23 years old, driven by curiosity and a constant desire to improve myself whether it’s through studying, hitting the gym, or challenging myself with climbing.

I’m a fullstack developer with a strong passion for the frontend world, especially when it comes to CSS, UI details, and creating smooth, intuitive user experiences. I love turning ideas into interfaces that feel clean, responsive, and enjoyable to use.
